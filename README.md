# Bike Simulation

Welcome to our "Bike Simulation" project! This project was developed as part of our "Computer Graphics" course using the C++ programming language. The simulation showcases a virtual bike riding experience with interactive controls.

## Project Overview

Our "Bike Simulation" project aims to create a visually engaging and interactive virtual environment where users can experience bike riding through various scenes. The project focuses on applying computer graphics concepts to create realistic graphics and user interactions.

## Features

- **Virtual Bike Riding**: Users can control a virtual bike and navigate it through the simulated environment.
- **Interactive Controls**: The simulation provides interactive controls for steering, accelerating, and braking the bike.
- **Scenery Changes**: Different scenes showcase various environments, adding diversity to the experience.
- **Realistic Graphics**: Applying computer graphics techniques to create visually appealing and immersive graphics.

## Technologies used

- **C++**
- **Code::Blocks Editor**

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilgugwad/Bike-Simulation.git
   cd bike-simulation
2. Open the project in the Code::Blocks editor.
3. Build and compile the C++ code using Code::Blocks.
4. Run the compiled executable to start the bike simulation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Implement advanced shading techniques to enhance the realism of the graphics.**
- **Introduce more interactive elements, such as obstacles and challenges.**
- **Optimize performance for smoother and more responsive user interactions.**
